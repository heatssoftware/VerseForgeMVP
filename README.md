# VerseForge MVP  
*Here will be all of the first updates of the VerseForge MVP*

## 🚀 About the Project  
**VerseForge** is a desktop application that allows you to sync song lyrics with music in real time, create animated backgrounds and personalize the visual experience of your music. Visit my website for more: [verseforge.site](https://verseforge.site)  
Major features include (or will include):  
- Lyrics animations that follow each word along with the song.  
- Beat and tempo detection so the visual effects match the music precisely.  
- A Theme Marketplace — explore, install and share community-made visual themes.  
- A Theme Creator/Editor — customize visual effects and code your own.  
- A powerful desktop music experience with visual sync at its core.

## 🎯 MVP Goal  
This repository is dedicated to the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** phase — a quick release to showcase the concept and gather user feedback.  
Key objectives:  
- Deliver one working screen with animations and audio visualization.  
- Provide a stable core experience — user opens the app and sees a visually synced music/lyrics scene.  
- Build an update mechanism (for example via GitHub Releases) to quickly ship future versions, themes and features.  
- Set a foundation for the Marketplace, Editor and Settings panel in upcoming releases.

## 📦 What’s Available Right Now  
- A single theme screen with animation and audio-visualization.  
- A stable demo version.  
- GitHub Releases tracking version history and future updates.

## 🔜 Next Steps  
- Add a **Settings / Preferences** panel — user control of visual and audio effects.  
- Expand the **Theme Marketplace** — community themes, sharing and installation.  
- Develop the **Theme Editor / Creator** — visual and code editor for user-made themes.  
- Integrate **Streaming Services** (e.g., Spotify, YouTube Music) — automatic audio recognition and lyric sync.  
- Publish a production-ready version with **Code Signing** and polished installer.

## 📝 Why Join or Try Now  
- Be among the first community members to try VerseForge.  
- Your feedback will directly shape upcoming features.  
- I am looking for theme creators, visual artists and beta testers to grow the community.
